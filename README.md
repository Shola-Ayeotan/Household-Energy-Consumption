# Household Energy Consumption: Analysis of Usage Behaviour with K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering Techniques

## Overview
This project explored patterns in household electricity consumption to inform sustainable energy practices, using K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering techniques on an energy usage dataset compiled from observing a residential building in Sceaux, France.

## Research Question
What are the underlying patterns in electricity consumption and their relations to user behaviours, temporal trends, and appliance-specific usage?

## Objectives
- Apply K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to uncover hidden patterns in electricity consumption.
- Compare the results of these clustering techniques and understand their implications.
- Correlate identified patterns with user behaviours, appliance usage, and sustainability practices.

## Dataset
Sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the dataset comprises over 2 million measurements from a residential building in Sceaux, France.

## Data Attributes
- Date and Time of consumption
- Global Active and Reactive Power
- Voltage
- Global Intensity
- Sub-metering for various appliances

## Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and handling missing values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing consumption patterns.
- Clustering Analysis: Employing K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
- Evaluation and Comparison: Using metrics like Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python and its libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Findings
- Five distinct clusters representing different consumption patterns were identified.
- Key insights into the impact of user behaviour and appliance usage on energy consumption.
- Potential for tailored sustainability measures based on consumption patterns.
